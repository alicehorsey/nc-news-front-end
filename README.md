# News Application Front End Project

https://alices-news-application.netlify.app/

## About the Project
This project was the culmination of my three week front end coding block on the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp. I spent a week working on the project, using React to create a simple yet effective mimik news application called Northcoders News!

I used Axios to make asynchronous API calls to the server I made during my nc-news back end project.

There is error handling throughout the project, and loading statements which show when information is being retrieved from the API.

### The Brief
Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Think something along the lines of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article. Comments can also be up or down voted. A user can add comments and remove any comments which they have added.

This review sprint should consolidate your understanding of making a [C.R.U.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) application from a front end perspective.
